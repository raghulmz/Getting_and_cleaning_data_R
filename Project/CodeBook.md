Description of Variables, Data files and the working of the script `run_analysis.R`

###Variables in output file(s)

* `activity_label` <br>
   Name of activity (laying, sitting, standing, walking, walking\_downstairs, walking\_upstairs)
* `subject_no.` <br>
   Subject number (1 to 30)
* `activity_no.` <br>
   Activity number (1 to 6)
* The other columns are as described in the original data set

###Input Data
* **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones** from **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.<br><br>
 **Data** - https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip<br>
**Website** - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones<br>
###Output files

* **Step 2 Output**<br>
`output_mean_std_extracted.txt` - Data extract of mean and std columns

* **Step 5 Output**<br> 
`output_means_extracted.txt` -Column Means when grouped by activity and subject
### The `run_analysis.R`

1. Read data from the following files<br><br>
Training Features - `X_train.txt`<br>
Training Response -`Y_train.txt`<br>
Test Features - `X_test.txt`<br>
Test Response - `Y_test.txt`<br>
Training Subjects - `subject_train.txt`<br>
Test Subjects - `subject_test.txt`<br>
Features (Column Names) - `features_file.txt`<br>
Activity Labels - `activity_label_file.txt`<br>

2. Apply column names (feature names) 

3. Combine (`cbind`) ***features, activity*** and ***subject*** data frames together to form two data sets, ***test*** and ***train***

4. Combine (`rbind`) ***test data*** and ***train data*** together

5. Get names of ***“mean()”*** and ***“std()”*** features (`grep`).

6. Extract required features using the list of names

7. Add descriptive activity labels.

8. Write data file of extracted data (***mean*** and ***std*** columns)<br>
`output_means_extracted.txt`

9. Group and split data by ***"activity"*** and by ***"subject"***

10. Calculate means using `sapply`

11. Transpose Matrix, add ***“activity\_label”*** and ***“subject\_no.”*** columns

12. Tidy up data and Write data file of ***means when grouped by activity and subject***<br>
`output_means_by_activity_subject.txt`
